Though I felt like we never had the time to fully understand each other, but the time we did spend, was every bit worth it. Still remember those days we'd argue about a movie, some marvel/DC bs or have geeky discussions on topics.<br><br>‚ñ™Ô∏éI also deeply remember when you genuinely helped me during our board exams, by sending me notes when I was in a pickle, helping clear my doubts before exams and many more. I still remember consulting you about what to do before physics boards because I opened my book for the first time, 2 days before the exam. If it wasnt for all that, who knows how poorly I would've done.<br><br>‚ñ™Ô∏éEvery moment spent with you was fun and exciting. The banter we had, shit we talked about, everything. Nothing was amiss, even the heated arguments and all the toxicity we had at times. Everything. I'll most certainly never ever forget. I've said it before, and will say it again, you're my joke buddy, my joke sidekick!<br><br>(^ ^)b.<br><br>Been a long ride, and I'm happy to spend it with you.<br><br>&hearts;<br><br>‚ñ™Ô∏éNote: bitchass dont come at me with the Avengers endgame or Dragon Ball Super bs again (Dennis cut this part out)",

So in my attempts to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù I came over to both of you and asked you your names. I asked you to repeat your name 4-5 times and still didn‚Äôt get it.<br>I remember thinking, man, this school is going to suck. Fast forward to today, yes, school sucked. But you made it bearable. But you didn‚Äôt stop there, every day beginning March, you sent stupid meemees and terrible mental health jokes. I laugh every time I open your messages, not because they‚Äôre funny, but because they‚Äôre really stupid and only you can send ridiculous things like that.<br>So thank you, for making me laugh, on bright days and terrible nights. I hope I can return the favor some day. I will not miss you because it looks like we still have a long way to go and you‚Äôre not that far away so don‚Äôt cry.<br>You‚Äôre a wonderful human being, but I‚Äôll never ever ever ever ever call you Batman. I will not.<br>Happy birthday not-Batman<br>Have a good one<br>Have many many more.",
