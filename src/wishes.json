Though I felt like we never had the time to fully understand each other, but the time we did spend, was every bit worth it. Still remember those days we'd argue about a movie, some marvel/DC bs or have geeky discussions on topics.<br><br>▪︎I also deeply remember when you genuinely helped me during our board exams, by sending me notes when I was in a pickle, helping clear my doubts before exams and many more. I still remember consulting you about what to do before physics boards because I opened my book for the first time, 2 days before the exam. If it wasnt for all that, who knows how poorly I would've done.<br><br>▪︎Every moment spent with you was fun and exciting. The banter we had, shit we talked about, everything. Nothing was amiss, even the heated arguments and all the toxicity we had at times. Everything. I'll most certainly never ever forget. I've said it before, and will say it again, you're my joke buddy, my joke sidekick!<br><br>(^ ^)b.<br><br>Been a long ride, and I'm happy to spend it with you.<br><br>&hearts;<br><br>▪︎Note: bitchass dont come at me with the Avengers endgame or Dragon Ball Super bs again (Dennis cut this part out)",
