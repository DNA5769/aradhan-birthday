Though I felt like we never had the time to fully understand each other, but the time we did spend, was every bit worth it. Still remember those days we'd argue about a movie, some marvel/DC bs or have geeky discussions on topics.<br><br>▪︎I also deeply remember when you genuinely helped me during our board exams, by sending me notes when I was in a pickle, helping clear my doubts before exams and many more. I still remember consulting you about what to do before physics boards because I opened my book for the first time, 2 days before the exam. If it wasnt for all that, who knows how poorly I would've done.<br><br>▪︎Every moment spent with you was fun and exciting. The banter we had, shit we talked about, everything. Nothing was amiss, even the heated arguments and all the toxicity we had at times. Everything. I'll most certainly never ever forget. I've said it before, and will say it again, you're my joke buddy, my joke sidekick!<br><br>(^ ^)b.<br><br>Been a long ride, and I'm happy to spend it with you.<br><br>&hearts;<br><br>▪︎Note: bitchass dont come at me with the Avengers endgame or Dragon Ball Super bs again (Dennis cut this part out)",

So in my attempts to “make friends” I came over to both of you and asked you your names. I asked you to repeat your name 4-5 times and still didn’t get it.<br>I remember thinking, man, this school is going to suck. Fast forward to today, yes, school sucked. But you made it bearable. But you didn’t stop there, every day beginning March, you sent stupid meemees and terrible mental health jokes. I laugh every time I open your messages, not because they’re funny, but because they’re really stupid and only you can send ridiculous things like that.<br>So thank you, for making me laugh, on bright days and terrible nights. I hope I can return the favor some day. I will not miss you because it looks like we still have a long way to go and you’re not that far away so don’t cry.<br>You’re a wonderful human being, but I’ll never ever ever ever ever call you Batman. I will not.<br>Happy birthday not-Batman<br>Have a good one<br>Have many many more.",

You have no idea how much you have inspired me throughout the years. there have been countless times when ive just looked up to you and learnt to better deal with the problems at hand. A part of your personality is embedded in me(the jokes mostly). and i just want you to know that we all love you. and you're really precious to me. we may or may not be in regular touch with each other once you find pussy and cocaine in canada, but I'll be at peace cuz deep down I know very well that i have made a friend for a lifetime.",
