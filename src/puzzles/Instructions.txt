Hello Batman,

I have kidnapped some ordinary sexy, big dick, thicc butt civilian and
the only way to save him/they (I would choose getting beat up by Batman
anytime over getting cancelled) is by solving riddles.

You'll receive a puzzle, to which you have to find the key (answer) and
type into the textbox back in the website, which will give you more puzzles.
The puzzles are really hard but not too hard because this is meant to represent 
~~your ED~~ life. If you make a wrong guess to the key, then you'll be shown
graphic and disturbing images, **so make sure your parents aren't around**.
Oh, wait a min.

So yes, to get your first puzzle,
Type "I love you, Dennis"
*yeah this is the only way I'm getting to listen to that :(*
